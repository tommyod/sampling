    Draw samples from a collection.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    population: list
        The data points. 
    
    replace: bool
        Sample with or without replacement.
        
    weights: list
        One weight per data point. If None is

    list
    Returns a new list of length size containing elements from the population

    --------
    >>> data = [1, 3, 4, 7]
    >>> weights = [3, 4, 2, 1]
